# Monopoly Strategic Advisor
A lightweight, browser-based tool to help players make smarter Monopoly investment decisions based on ROI and game state.

## Overview
The Monopoly Strategic Advisor is a web application that provides real-time property investment recommendations in the Monopoly board game.
